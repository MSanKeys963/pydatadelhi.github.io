Share your Lightning Talks! A "lightning talk" is a quick mini-presentation
(5 minutes maximum) on any Python, Julia, R, tips & tricks, caveats or personal
project you'd like. We'll save time for 2-3 of these each month: to save a
spot, post a comment with your talk's title/topic and create an issue at
[https://github.com/pydatadelhi/talks/issues](https://github.com/pydatadelhi/talks/issues). 
Beginner topics are always welcome!

See you at the meetup! ‚úåüèª
