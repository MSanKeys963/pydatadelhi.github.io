PyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization
in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community
of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from
each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices,
new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing,
analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using
many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.

We aim to be an accessible, community-driven conference, with novice to advanced
level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest
project features along with cutting-edge use cases.
